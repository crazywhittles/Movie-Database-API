# Movie Database API
## Mongodb CRUD API Project

Welcome to my CRUD API Project that stores Movies in MongoDB

This API project has GET, POST, PATCH and DELETE requests to manage the movies in the db.

movie.json is an example of the format for the db.

How to use:

To start the app.js file, type `node .\app.js` into the terminal. To see all the movies in
the db, type:
(http://localhost:4000/movie) into your browser, or I prefer to do this in POSTMAN.
